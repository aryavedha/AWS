Step-by-Step Debugging (AWS EC2):
1. Check if the volume is visible at all

Run:
lsblk

"(Do you see /dev/xvdf in the output?)"
(or)
/dev/nvme

You're likely using a Nitro-based EC2 instance, and EBS volumes appear as /dev/nvme... instead of /dev/xvdf.

Then format and mount it:
bash

# Replace nvme1n1 with your actual device name

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nvme1n1
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/myvolume
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/myvolume

Make it Mount on Reboot:

before that Backup the /etc/fstab file for safeside.

sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak

Add to /etc/fstab:
bash
echo "/dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/myvolume ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

Final Reminder:
Stop trying to use /dev/xvdf manually if you're on a Nitro-based EC2 instance â€” use the actual device name (nvme1n1, etc.) as shown by lsblk.

(Mount Command):

Create a mount point (directory):
bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/myvolume

Mount the device (example uses /dev/nvme1n1):
bash
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/myvolume

"Replace /dev/nvme1n1 with your actual device (you can find it using lsblk)."

(To Check Mount):
bash
df -hT

(Unmount Command):

To unmount the volume:
bash
sudo umount /mnt/myvolume

If the volume is busy (used by a process), you may need to stop that process first or use:
bash
sudo fuser -vm /mnt/myvolume

To force unmount:
bash
sudo umount -l /mnt/myvolume
